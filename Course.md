# Under construction

This page will host our course on "Information Theory for analysing Complex Systems", providing the student a theoretical introduction to the relevant tools from information theory, and a practical guide to using JIDT for such analysis. Substantial content will be provided here, including video lectures, tutorial activities and sample code.

For the time being, lecture slides are available in the ```course``` folder of the distribution (from v1.4.1).

A shorter introduction to JIDT is available as a [Tutorial](Tutorial).
